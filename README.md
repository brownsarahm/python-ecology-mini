## Data Carpentry Python Lessons with Ecological Data

This repository contains an excerpt from the Data Carpentry Python material based on ecological data. Additionally, this includes an extra emphasis on features of jupyter notebooks and leverages the `load` magic to reduce typing and allow learners to reach a further point in the lesson given limited time.  

For easy download for the students this has an accompanying [files repo](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-ecology-files/).  Easily and automatically provide students with a zip download link using the github zip download.
